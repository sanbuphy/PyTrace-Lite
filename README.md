# PyTrace-Lite
A simple tool helps you trace the python program.	  

I think the official python trace document is not written well, so I rewrite the code.	  

The official filter seems don't work, so I write my filter code.	  

My demo is used to trace the MMDetection code, you can change it.

As the saying goes,read the code is worse than read the execution.—— jyy 

子曾经曰过，读代码不如读执行，优雅调试前提是舒服 —— [jyy wiki](https://jyywiki.cn/OS/2022/slides/29.slides#/2/2)

## Usage
1. First, add the function that you want to the main()

2. Run it and wait some time!
```shell
python powerful_trace.py
```

You can search the function in main() to find the specific output location in csv.
