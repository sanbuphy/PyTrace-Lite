# PyTrace-Lite
A simple tool helps you trace the python programs.	  

I believe the official python trace document wat not written well, so I rewrite the code.	  

The official filter seems to not be woking, so I write my own filter code.	  

My demo is used to trace the MMDetection code, you can change it.

## Usage
1. First, added the functions you want to the main() function.

2. Run it and wait!
```shell
python powerful_trace.py
```

You can search the function in main() to find the specific output location in csv.
