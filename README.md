# PyTrace-Lite
A simple tool helps you trace the python program.	
I think the official python trace document is not written well, so I rewrite the code.	
The official filter seems don't work, so I write my filter code.	

My demo is used to trace the MMDetection code, you can change it.

## Usage
1. First, add the function that you want to the main()

2. Run it and wait some time!
```shell
python powerful_trace.py
```

You can search the function in main() to find the specific output location in csv.
